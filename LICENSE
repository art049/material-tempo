                          Moral license

Although you are allowed to not,
I hope that you use this software under these terms:

  1. Adding nothing to it, and publishing it
    If you copy this software, I want you to add your own work and effort to it.
    If none to minimal changes are made, you should credit me appropriately.
    Example of appropriate credit:
      This software was originally written by Roope Salmi (ollpu),
      {link to project repository on GitHub if available}
      
  2. Making substantial changes to it
    If you make larger changes, as in changing the appearance or adding a new
    feature to it, I'd still appreciate the appropriate credit as mentioned in term 1.
    If you make some nice changes to the software, I want you to publish your
    version of the software with an MIT license or similar. I greatly appreciate
    your modifications, and possibly want to implement those changes in my version
    of the software as well.
    
   2.1. Using a similar layout or concept, but making most of it yourself
    If you make a similar software with similar features, layout and/or concepts,
    It's all yours. If you've made it, it's yours. If you do however,
    use some code from this project, I'm completely fine with that as well,
    although I hope to receive the appropriate credit (refer to term 1).
    
  3. Monetized content
    If this piece of software happens to have some kind of a revenue source for me,
    such as selling it for a fee or implementing advertizements,
    I hope that you do not recompile the software without these revenue sources.
    If the software is being sold for a fee, the worst thing you could do,
    is selling it on, but claiming all profit yourself.

Keep in mind, that this moral license is only a moral license. You are still allowed
to do almost whatever you want with it (refer to the MIT License above), but if you
want to be my friend, you might want to abide to these terms.
  If you have anything to ask, or think that the above license is too strict,
                          hit me up on email, or Telegram, @ollpu.

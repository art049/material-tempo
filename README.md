# material-tempo
A neat looking and useful Android Tempo (BPM) Tapper made with material design standards in mind.

##What it is
Material Tempo is a rather simple application. It does a thing or two with music's BPM (or speed, if you will).
 - First of all, the first tab let's you tap in a tempo
 (you press the Tap Here button atleast 8 times)
 and the app calculates the you tapped.
  - You can even measure your heartrate with this!
  - The first tab also shows you the Italian tempo markings associated with the specific tempo
 - Favorites system [under developement]
   - You can add a favorite by pressing the star in the "About x BPM" card
   - Favorites are put in the favorites tab
